OBJECTIVE
 
Apply
 
data
 
preprocessing
 
and
 
visualization
 
techniques
 
and
 
understand
 
how
 
poor
 
data
 
quality
 
impacts
 
machine
 
learning
 
models
 
and
 
the
 
ML
 
lifecycle.

PART
 
1:
 
Data
 
Understanding
 
&
 
Quality
 
Issues
 
(3
 
Marks)
 
 
-
 
Load
 
the
 
dataset
 
and
 
inspect
 
the
 
shape,
 
data
 
types,
 
and
 
missing
 
values.
 
 
-
 
Identify
 
at
 
least
 
five
 
data
 
quality
 
issues
 
and
 
explain
 
them
 
briefly.
 
 
 
PART
 
2:
 
Data
 
Cleaning
 
&
 
Preprocessing
 
(4
 
Marks)
 
 
-
 
Handle
 
missing
 
values
 
with
 
justification.
 
 
-
 
Explain
 
why
 
a
 
particular
 
technique(dropping,filling
 
with
 
mean/median)
 
was
 
chosen
 
and
 
its
  
impact
 
on
 
data
 
quality
 
 
-
 
Convert
 
data
 
into
 
correct
 
formats
 
(dates,
 
duration).
 
 
-
 
Encode
 
categorical
 
variables.
 
 
-
 
Normalize
 
or
 
standardize
 
numerical
 
features.
 
 
 
PART
 
3:
 
Data
 
Visualization
 
(4
 
Marks)
 
 -  One  distribution  plot.  
 
-
 
One
 
categorical
 
count
 
plot.
 
 
-
 
One
 
numerical
 
comparison
 
plot.
 
 
-
 
Provide
 
interpretation
 
for
 
each
 
plot.
 
Each  visualization  must  be  followed  by  a  brief  interpretation  explaining  observed  trends  and  
their
 
relevance
 
to
 
ML
.
 
 
 
PART
 
4:
 
ML
 
Readiness
 
Check
 
(2
 
Marks)
 
 
-
 
Select
 
a
 
target
 
variable.
 
 
-
 
Train
 
Logistic
 
Regression
 
or
 
Decision
 
Tree.
 
 
-
 
Compare
 
performance
 
before
 
and
 
after
 
preprocessing.
 
Performance  comparison  should  be  based  on  accuracy  (or  similar  metric)  and  briefly  explain  
why
 
preprocessing
 
affected
 
the
 
results.
 
 
 
PART
 
5:
 
ML
 
Lifecycle
 
Reflection
 
(2
 
Marks)
 
 
-
 
Explain
 
which
 
ML
 
lifecycle
 
stages
 
fail
 
without
 
preprocessing.
 
 
-
 
Give
 
one
 
concrete
 
example
 
from
 
this
 
assignment.
